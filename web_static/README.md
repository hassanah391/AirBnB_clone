# Airbnb Clone

## Description
This project represents one phase of the Airbnb Clone, focusing on the HTML and CSS implementation. The **Images** folder contains various icons used across the site (e.g., logo, bathroom, bedroom, and guest icons). The **Styles** folder includes the CSS files used to style the page. The file with the highest number in each category (e.g., common, footer, header, places) corresponds to the most complete or finished styling for that section. Similarly, the highest numbered `index.html` file is the most up-to-date version of the layout.
